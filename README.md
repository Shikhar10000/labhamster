# labhamster
Django project for simple purchase / order management in scientific labs

Labhamster is a simple Django project for tracking materials and reagents ordered for a scientific laboratory 
and offers a rudimentary inventory management. For now it is not much more than the out-of-the-box Django 
admin interface with a pretty standard data model.
